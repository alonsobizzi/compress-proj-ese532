#include 

struct controlStruct // Structure containing all parameters that are being fed into the code

//Suspect there will eventually be a command queue lumped into the chunkStructure but unwise to do now

struct chunkStruct // Structure containing transient data for a chunk to be passed to a worker (sequential initially) (Ari made this I think)

This is a where I will put SHA stuff. Current plan noted in note webapp thing


Demo: Partitioned, using SHA files library. Push library into overall program. Depends on c file in lib.

Build demo with make demo 

Clean with make clean

How to use
In init : int sockfd = init_sha3_socket();
In std / main : compute_sha3_hash(int sockfd, const void *input, size_t len, unsigned char *digest) 

sockfd - from init
*input ptr to input - void since it is just bits to sha
len - unsigned integer of size_t type. this is largest possible size of a piece of data or index for the system 
 -- basically a long uint that keeps this pretty universal  maybe change to uint since we dont really car
 
*digest - Where the output sha value going. Should be unsigned char to big enough place to store a 386 bit value (48 byte) - gets funky...
